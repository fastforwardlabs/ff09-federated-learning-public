## Conclusion

As we discuss throughout this report, particularly in [5.1 Privacy](#privacy) and
[6.1 Reducing Communication Costs](#reducing-communication-costs), federated learning is not a perfect solution to the two
problems mentioned in [1. Introduction](#introduction): training data is often private and
communication is often expensive. But federated learning _is_ a good start!

It addresses problems that affect the most regulated, competitive, and
profitable industries. It also has the potential to be of huge benefit to
worldwide healthcare outcomes. For this reason, we expect distributed,
privacy-preserving, communication-minimizing machine learning to remain an
active area of research and commercial experimentation for many years.

In moving the majority of the work to the edge, federated learning is part of the
trend to move machine learning out of the data center, for reasons that include
speed and cost. But in federated learning, the edge nodes create and improve the
model (rather than merely applying it). In this sense, federated learning goes 
far beyond what people usually mean when they talk about edge AI. 

Federated learning points to a future in which we work collectively to
apply machine learning to some of toughest problems that humanity faces, while
each retaining control over our own data.
